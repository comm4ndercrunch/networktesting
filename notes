#Pseudocode, notes, and variables listed

Program will use host's NIC/Network connection to run testing.  The program will test:
IP connectivity using ping to well known web addresses (ex. 8.8.8.8, OR 4.4.2.2)
IP connectivity using ping to default gateway
IP connectivity using ping to well known DNS addresses; ex. google.com (optional / functionality reserved for later versions)
ARP resolution to local network (optional / functionality reserved for later versions)

If IP connectivity to web addresses fail; 
  check the results of IP connectivity to secondary web address
    if primary web address fails test but secondary succeeds
      replace primary web address with secondary for repeated tests
    else if both primary and secondary we addresses fail
      compare to results of connectivity to default gateway
        if web fails and gateway succeed
          send user prompt that internet access is down
        else if both web and gateway tests fail
          test loopback
            if loopback succeeds
              prompt user that local network is down
            else if local network and loopback fail
              prompt user that host's connectivity is faulty and to restart host

Variables:  
Ping test intervals (default 1 test/20seconds)
Number of probes (default 4)
Ping test IPs (default 8.8.8.8 primary, 4.4.2.2 secondary)
Default gateway 

Python Modules:
sys, os

Python Commands:
